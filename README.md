# Voice_Assistant
This Python script implements a personal voice assistant using the speech_recognition, pyttsx3, and pywhatkit libraries. It can listen for user commands, process them, and respond with appropriate actions like playing songs on YouTube, providing jokes, or opening websites (e.g., Google, Spotify, Netflix).
